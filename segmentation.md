Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and state-of-the-art in terms of image segmentation and instance segmentation
We create instance segmentation on images on the home depot website across various categories in the kitchen super category. A few examples are sink, bowl, and oven which have been presented in below.
There are many advantages of MaskRCNN. Some of them are its simplicity, high accuracy and performance, Efficiency, and Flexibility.
We used the pre-trained COCO Model that is being used for image segmentation and by transfer-learning used our custom dataset from the Home Depot website to nudge the weights towards a direction where it is able to segment images according to kitchen appliances.
